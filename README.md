# activity
something like github activities to log my reading and ratings for a book
cause i don't like good reads and this gets the job done for me. 
i still use good reads to find books tho.

Simple workflow, the page reads content from a json file corresponding to the current year
checks if you logged anything for this month if u didn't says you were slacking off and displays only books for the current year.

```log.sh``` a simpler way to automate the task of logging books to the json file with the corresponding year.
